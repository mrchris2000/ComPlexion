ComPlexion
==========

Companion library for Plex to load details from a Plex media server

So far this is a very early alpha, just putting it out there to start garnering feedback.

To use:

Use the MyPlexConnection class to connect to a MyPlex account, or create an instance of the Server class pointing to a local server.  You can then see whats currently playing.

You **MUST** have a Plex Pass subscription to use this.
